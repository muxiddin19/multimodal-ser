# Create Architecture Documentation

You are tasked with creating comprehensive architecture documentation for this codebase.

## Documentation Requirements

Please analyze the codebase and create documentation covering:

### 1. System Overview
- High-level purpose and goals of the system
- Key stakeholders and use cases
- Technology stack and dependencies

### 2. Architecture Patterns
- Overall architectural style (e.g., MVC, microservices, layered, etc.)
- Design patterns used throughout the codebase
- Key architectural decisions and their rationale

### 3. Component Structure
- Major components/modules and their responsibilities
- Component interactions and dependencies
- Data flow between components
- Directory/package organization

### 4. Data Architecture
- Data models and schemas
- Database design (if applicable)
- Data flow and transformations
- State management approach

### 5. API/Interface Design
- Public APIs and endpoints
- Internal interfaces
- Communication protocols
- Authentication/authorization mechanisms

### 6. Infrastructure & Deployment
- Deployment architecture
- Environment configuration
- Build and deployment process
- Infrastructure dependencies

### 7. Security Considerations
- Authentication and authorization
- Data protection mechanisms
- Security best practices followed
- Known security considerations

### 8. Performance & Scalability
- Performance optimization strategies
- Scalability considerations
- Caching strategies
- Resource management

### 9. Testing Strategy
- Testing approach and frameworks
- Test coverage areas
- Quality assurance processes

### 10. Development Workflow
- Development setup instructions
- Contribution guidelines
- Code organization conventions
- Key development tools

## Output Format

Create the documentation as a well-structured markdown file with:
- Clear headings and sections
- Diagrams where helpful (using Mermaid syntax)
- Code examples where relevant
- Links to related files with line references (e.g., `file.ts:123`)

## Analysis Approach

1. **Explore the codebase structure** - Understand the directory layout
2. **Identify entry points** - Find main files, server files, CLI entry points
3. **Map dependencies** - Understand how components relate
4. **Document patterns** - Identify recurring patterns and conventions
5. **Create diagrams** - Visualize architecture and data flow
6. **Write comprehensive documentation** - Produce clear, actionable documentation

Please begin by exploring the codebase structure and then generate comprehensive architecture documentation.
